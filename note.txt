In React 18, SSRProvider is not necessary and is a noop. You can remove it from your app.

1. Navigate to node_modules/native-base/src/core/NativeBaseProvider.tsx.
2. Delete the <SSRProvider></SSRProvider> that wraps {children}. Take care not to delete {children}.
3. Remove the SSRProvider import. That is, delete this line: import { SSRProvider } from '@react-native-aria/utils';.
4. Run npx patch-package native-base. Select 'yes' in the prompt.

When Native Base officially fixes it, you can delete the patch from the patch directory that was created and reinstall native-base
